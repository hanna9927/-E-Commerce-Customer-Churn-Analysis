-- Rename the column "HourSpendOnApp" to "HoursSpentOnApp".

-- Creating New Columns:
-- ➢ Create a new column named ‘ComplaintReceived’ with values "Yes" if the corresponding value in the ‘Complain’ is 1, and "No" otherwise.
ALTER TABLE customer_churn ADD COLUMN ComplaintReceived VARCHAR(20);
UPDATE customer_churn set ComplaintReceived = 
	CASE 
		WHEN Complain = 1 THEN 'YES'
		ELSE 'NO'

-- ➢ Create a new column named 'ChurnStatus'. Set its value to “Churned” if the corresponding value in the 'Churn' column is 1, else assign “Active”.

UPDATE customer_churn SET ChurnStatus =
	CASE 
		WHEN Churn = 1 then "Churned"

-- Column Dropping:
-- ➢ Drop the columns "Churn" and "Complain" from the table.
ALTER TABLE Customer_churn DROP COLUMN Churn,DROP COLUMN Complain;
